# 0006 â€” Incremental parsing & performance for large files

Status: closed  
Closed: 2025-09-23  
Superseded by: Issue 0010 (Performance Benchmarks & Optimization)

## Closure Reason

This issue has been superseded by **Issue 0010 - Performance Benchmarks & Optimization**, which provides a more comprehensive approach to performance including:

- Systematic benchmarking of parsing performance on large files
- Memory usage profiling and optimization
- LSP operation performance measurement  
- CI integration for performance regression detection
- Concrete performance targets and success metrics

The goals of this issue (handling large files, responsive edits, bounded memory) are all addressed in the new comprehensive performance framework.
